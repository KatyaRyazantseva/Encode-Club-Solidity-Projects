# Team 12 Week 2 Ballot Project

## Setup

This project uses npm to install dependencies. `npm install`

It also requires you to have a local .env file placed into the source directory with the following format (this can also be found in the .env.example file)
```.env
MNEMONIC="here is where your twelve words mnemonic should be put my friend"
PRIVATE_KEY="<your private key here if you don't have a mnemonic seed>"
INFURA_API_KEY="********************************"
INFURA_API_SECRET="********************************"
ALCHEMY_API_KEY="********************************"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="********************************"
CONTRACT_ADDRESS="The address of the contract you create using the deploy script"
```
